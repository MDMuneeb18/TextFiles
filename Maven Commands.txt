Maven Commands :

cls 		- clears the previous executions in cmd

mvn validate 	- this command will validate the project is correct or not and 
		  all necessary information is avilable or not
		  all the required files for the project are present or not

mvn clean 	- removes all the files generated by previous build
		  suppose if we run our project previously multiple times the temporary files in the target folder 		  will be created, so those all will be cleaned up

mvn compile	- compiles the source code of the project what ever we have written in the project
		  whatever classes we have created it compiles them (basically written in src\main\java)

mvn test	- before test there are multiple phases, so it will cross all those phases then compiler comes to 		  test phase
		  This command will compile also. Internally 4 plugins are executing

mvn package	- this command will create a jar file.
		  Whatever command we compiled, executed and tested we need to package it. That package will be in 
		  jar format and sometimes it will be in war format and that file will be generated. And that file 		  we can share with others
		  Before executing this command it will execute all other commands

mvn install 	- this command will do the same work as "mvn package" and it will copy that jar file in local 			  repository.
		  Deploys the jar file in local repository(adds in Maven Dependencies folder)
		  Does everything package does, plus it installs the packaged artifact into your local Maven 			  repository (so other projects can use it).

mvn deploy	- Now that particular jar file is present in our local repository.
		  If we want to deploy that jar file in remote location or remote applications then we use this 		  command
		  in remote maven repositories
		  here we have to specify the configuration where to deploy
